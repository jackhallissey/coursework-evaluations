Coursework for CS2516 (Algorithms and Data Structures II) and CS3204 (Cloud Infrastructure and Services).

# Algorithms and Data Structures

- An evaluation of different variants of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in undirected weighted graphs.

# Cloud Infrastructure and Services

- Assignment 4: Exploring virtual machine technologies by comparing the execution time of a performance-sensitive program for matrix multiplication on a host system and in a virtual machine.
- Assignment 5: Exploring Docker containerization technology by comparing the execution of time of the same program in a virtual machine and in a Docker container.
